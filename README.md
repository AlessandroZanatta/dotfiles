# dotfiles

The dotfiles im using for my DE.

## My setup

Currently running AwesomeWM and its default bar, wibar. DE-free!

## Structure
I keep my dotfiles in a separate directory (mine's `~/dotfiles`, but it can be anything really). 
Then, I (soft) symlink everything to where it belongs. Every file/folder in `config` is symlinked in `~/.config`, and every file in `home` is symlinked in `~/`.
